2,38876,NCR,P,3,4,3,4,3,17,5,0,We had hired the attender from Portea to take care of my brother  as he was on post operative rest. The attender was suffering from medical condition of FITS. He had not informed anyone at Portea about this medical condition. One day while he was giving food to my brother he had a FITS attack and collapsed on the floor. This was very dangerous. Thankfully we had help at hand and after some time the attender recovered & immediately left for his home. Please ensure that all your attenders undergo medical test & check their medical history . This could have been dangerous.

No papers, ids email or other communication to establish the assistants credentials were given, had to get my manager to run to Portea office in Hyd half a dozen times to collect id etc...

Remuneration was demanded in cash and then in individual names of managers of Portea - how can a professional organisation work like this..?

My manager was abused and warned that no future support will be given, wonder what support has really been given at all at least until now... Twice a week visits by nurse was said to check BP and other vitals - till date no such thing. 

The aaya is the bright spot, decent mannered, gentle, bit aged with language issues - but Portea hasn't paid to her despite Portea invoice was settled by us, 40-45 days without pay, the aaya plans to leave - unhappy with Portea.

Portea appointed Ms. Smita Sanjay Surve for this. From 28.04.2015 to 12.06.2015 she has taken leave of 1 day each on two occasions, 7 days on one occasion & 2 days on one occasion, a total of 11 days leave. Only on the first occasion did Portea Mumbai inform me about her leave. When the reliever did not turn up, I called up Bangalore office of Portea to lodge my complaint. On repeated requests to Ms. Smita to inform me about her leave prior hand, neither she nor Portea bothered to inform me about her leaves for the rest, forcing me to cancel prior appointments several times. On 11.06.2015, she came for 1 hour in the morning with a reliever Ms. Sabita & yet again, left on one day leave. When on 12.06.2015 morning no one turned up till 8.15 a. m I started enquiring about Smita. Mr. Joseph, of Portea Mumbai, had no idea as to why Smita was not coming for duty & tried to explain that she was late because of the rain/ late running of train. Smita did not come, neither did she pick up any of my innumerable phone calls. Later, Ms. Sabita came with an excuse that she didn't know about that day's reliever duty.

Kindly explain why am I paying Rs. 19,000 per month for such poor & unprofessional service considering the advanced age of my mother, who requires assistance in her daily activities.

Feed back - Not a complaint.
a) Both wife and self required blood samples to be taken. Same address.Same person collecting samples. 2 timings given 0700 hours and 0745 hours.
      Following could be better : Called your help line. Requested them send person collecting samples only once at 0745 hours. They said they will arrange. Also,called the person coming to collect the sample - no response. Sent him an SMS requesting him to come at 0745 hours. No response confirmation/back.
Called him early morning on sample collection day and spoke to him - requesting him to come at 0745 hours. He came early at 0715 - this interrupted our Yoga session.- which was acknowledged - requesting both to please send a hard copy of reports of both wife and self. Have not yet got it.

Had heard lot about portea but faced very bad service.

Had 01st appointment with Physiotherapist on 04th July and after her visit she checked my mother and planned a package of 15days which was to be started from 05th July but nobody came till 09th July for the same and not even anyone called us about any delays or physiotherapist not coming to our place. Even there was no response on the number given by the Physiotherapist given on her 01st visit.

Honestly speaking was thinking of suggesting my family / friends through social media / personally about the Portea but by the service given by portea would only make dent to my image hence will not recommend anyone about it.

Its not easy to make my mother (a Traumatic Brain Injury patient, & bed-ridden for 8 years) take interest in exercise. Dr. Rubina takes personal interest in my mother, makes great efforts in personalizing the exercise schedule & has successfully befriended her so that she's more open to exercising. As a result of her efforts, my mother has started sitting without support for more than an hour at a stretch - the 1st time in many years. She has also started standing (with support) for a few seconds. All our best wishes are with Dr. Rubina as she energetically goes about her treatments."

We have completed the 15 recommended sessions but there has been no follow up or intimation about it.  We had also left a message at your home page for extended sessions and also requesting additional services but no one has got back to us yet.

836,87101,Bangalore,P,3,4,2,2,3,14,2,-5,Prank ta was a night attendant for my mother who is visiting us in Mumbai. The service was required for a month. She was just required to keep an eye on my mother when she used toilet in the night and take her for an early morning walk as my mother uses a tripod walking stick to walk. Praneeta  will not let my mother use the fan if she did not feel the requirement. She will get up in the middle of the night to read the bible. She will switch on the light and disturb her. What really tested my mothers patience was her constant talk about Jesus. She appeared to be a born again Christian. My mother is not a very religious person and this constant talk about religion and God was too much for her. One day Praneeta came for work with high fever and my mom had to look after her through the night. In fact she had to sleep on the sofa in the drawing room as Praneeta did not want the fan. My mother is a very patient person and she told us all about her after trying for a couple of weeks. We terminated her and we did not take any replacement from protea as my mom felt she would rather do without anyone. She did not want another Praneeta. You really need to train your people before sending them off to other people's house. I would be grateful if someone from the feedback team would call me.

It was a lesson learnt not to call for your services ever again . My grand mother was rushed to the hospital within 24 hrs of your doctors visit coz he dnt even give her iv drip ..

We took a package for 15 sessions, he has finished around 10 and apparently the therapist fell ill and told my son that he will make arrangements for the replacement at once. The issue is important for two reasons: one my son is leaving the country for the US for higher studies and secondly the doctor wants to meet him and advice him further at the soonest. How can we go to the doctor without completing our sessions. One lady answered my call and promised to get back to me at once, never called and I had to contact someone else again. This is highly unpardonable. I was very happy in the first few days and disappointed as the sessions progressed.

The physiotherapist had not suggested any alternative to relieve pain except to take rest and call her after the pain subsides. The treatment has therefore been terminated.

As per the advice of Physiotherapist, I purchased a belt from Portea. I could not wear it more than 2 min as the back of the belt had a hard projection which was pressing on my pain point and increased the pain. The Physiotherapist offered to get the belt replaced but no action was taken even after a week. 

I had spent Rs 500 for initial assessment visit;  Rs 1600 for four days physiotherapist fee; Rs 860 for the belt which was not useful. And had a increase in my pain and had to be on pian killers for two days.

Patience tend to use portea since it is convenient option right at their door-steps & the patient with movement difficulty can concentrate more on their excise.
for eg. a patient cannot forsee a throbbing  headache before 24 hours. you are requested to reconsider the charges for rescheduling else we will be forced to look for alternatives."

1. Be transparent when you take the request from customers. i was told the report will be delivered within three hours but it took more than 24 hours. I was told that you have your own labs for clinical tests but it was wrong. I was told the hard copy will be delivered later but it never appeared.
2. It will be a good practice for your representative who came to collect blood samples to sanitize his hands before touching the patient and also it is a standard practice to wear sanitized disposable gloves while taking samples and handling the instruments.
3. We will appreciate if you can collect medical waste like used syringes, swabs etc for safe disposal at your end and to prevent any harm to domestic servants who handle the garbage.
4. It will infuse confidence in your clients if your person carried the necessary accessories in a proper medical carrier box instead of a dirty backpack stuffed haphazardly.
5. Customer ID was not mentioned correctly in the report sent by email causing some anxiety.
6. It took 3 hours to clarify whether the report sent to me was actually mine.

I was called 2 times by Portea for more info.
Portea didn't deliver the report in teh promised time of 12-36 hrs, and i had to fight and call all sorts of people to get the report that too partial one.

My humble suggestion to you is that if can't manage this then don't experiment wih customers, please be sensitive to the fact that you are in medical field and ignorance on your part could lead to someones death.

It is not her fault and doing diligently her assigned work,the fault is with Portea coordinators who need to choose the right attendant for the the type of patient they service. An aged parambulated lady can a 20 year old lift in case of emergency when the house persons are not around,the attendant so young is not lifting babies. This is what the coordinators assigned have to learn to assign duties."

As per my experience with portea was very poor. I am 100% not satisfied with this service bcz After fixing the appointment they visted my home and spend only 10 Mn of time with patient,They are charging 500/- for visiting fee. It looks like a (Say Hi, Hello, How r u,Bye, Good Bye) for that they are collecting money from patient without doing any service.

There was no follow up on whom I should contact when the nurse was appointed. When calling Portea was not aware of the facts. If I am to speak to the coordinator in Kolkata in case I want something, I was not told that.

You are a role model for many people, especially women, including me. And it<U+0092>s painful that our first intro is this way, ie, through a serious grievance against Portea, and i am left with no choice but to inbox this mail. Here is my rather agonizing journey with portea. 
24th Oct- I called your toll free no to get attendant services for my dad. They took my details and said they will arrange a call back and services form next day (25th OcT).
25th Oct (morning)- No services, no call. I did call 3-4 times on 24th to get status, only to get lame answers and false hope that someone will be there. They gave me Bangalore coordinator<U+0092>s phone no- Dilesh. He picked just once, only to start blaming toll free sales team. Verbatim <U+0093>they over sell, dont know ground reality, how could they commit an attendant etc without checking with me<U+0094> Then he said will call back, and as always he didn't just like others. Clearly left with no option sand disillusioned with this behavior from Portea staff, i put my comments on Portea FB page. 
25th Oct  (afternoon)- Simon from operations team calls me. Apologies etc. Said will arrange someone. Thankfully he did call back as committed. 
25th Oct ( late afternoon/ early evening) - Enters Dilesh again - so called Bangalore coordinator and the attendant. Dilesh -- let me remind you is same guy whom i spoke previous day and he didn<U+0092>t seem to once think before whining in front of customer. Anyways he came with attendant, took the cheque in advance and said all is sorted and this attendant will come for 2 weeks ( duration i signed for)
25th Oct- afternoon/ evening- I get call from Simon, which my husband took. He requested that we re-consider my comments on facebook now that issue is resolved. Wonder is that how you maintain your social fa<e7>ade<U+0085> Anyways I put a positive feedback on page, thinking to err is human<U+0085> But guess my mistake again to have believed in your services.
26th Oct- 31st Oct- Attendant came on time, left on time.. No issues as such, and i can<U+0092>t thank my stars enough for it<U+0085>. 
1st Nov, 8:15am- There , when I thought all is well with Portea way too soon<U+0085> No one turned up again. I called attendant, he gave me sob story how Portea deosnt pay, his pass is due and they havent given him pass yet and he has to spend from him end. And hence he isnot coming.. WOW.. Quite a not work culture at Portea I must admit!
1st Nov- 8:25am-  I tried calling Dilish - no response from him again. Wonder what is co-ordinator for when he cant pick phone and resolve issue- ever !! 
1st Nov- 8:30am - After numerous futile calls, i called Simon again. He again apologized and said he will sort out. But let me ask you this, how does apologizing help in reducing patient<U+0092>s agony, who is bed ridden, help me in returning my time<U+0097>for 2nd time in row I had to miss my commitments, and ease out the loss of peace caused by your staff. You deal in services which are crucial, a patient is relaying on you. Have you ever thought how a lapse can have serious consequences. 
1st Nov- 8:45am <U+0096> Simon called back, assured me that services will be resumed in 2 hrs.. Means, again my Sunday plans went down the drain.

1st Nov- 10am- The attendant finally came. 
1st Nov- 7pm- Attendant again said  that he will not be able to come next day as no pass yet and he might need to go to get it made.
1st Nov- 7pm- 8pm- I make endless calls to Dilesh<U+0097>as expected- he didn<U+0092>t pick call no called back. I treid calling Simon <U+0096>his phone was switched off. I tried calling team leader- Tangeer. He picked my phone (obviously not aware of the issue at my end). Once I informed him, there he too disconnected and never returned the call or picked my call.
8pm- Dilesh calls attendant and asks him to come out of house and meet on street. On being informed through attendant that we are trying to reach him he doesn<U+0092>t pay any heed still. 
8:30pm <U+0096> I manage to speak with Basant. He hears my plight, says will check and call. And thankfully he does. Tells me that Dilesh will call back and sort. Now I seriously doubt that Dilesh is any capable of handling any issue, yet no choice, so I waited for him to call
9:10 pm- Dilesh calls. Gave some vague excuses on why he missed my 20 calls since morning and evening. According to him, services will be resumed in morning at 8am, but honesty at this time I have no faith in any of the commitments made by your staff. Since I have no choice, I now have to pray and wait for morning and keep hoping someone turns up, else the same story if endless futile calls, time wasted starts again.
I think, as a start up, all your attention and efforts are going towards expansion and market share, however I think you should also take a step back and see what mechanisms you have to gather feedback and identify gaps like these, To me it appears, you are too keen on expanding, you advertise big, but at ground level, your units work in cilos, staff doesn<U+0092>t care of what they speak. No one bother about customers after taking money, thanks to your policy of advance payment and people at bottom level are the ones who in spite of working don<U+0092>t even get their dues, thereby impacting their loyalty to company or customers. 
I really do hope that after this, Portea finally wakes up and really does something to at least meet the standards and commitments that they have charged the customers , and then take a step forward to keep their customers happy<U+0085> 
From extremely dissatisfied customer- Rachna

We would like to see him continue being punctual and would expect him to reach our home at 7.30 am. He would give reasons that his PG gives breakfast at 8.00 am due to which it not possible for him to come early and since our house is at the interior, its difficult for him to come as there is not much transport available. Am assuming that his logistic are taken care by your team and he should not be unnecessary giving such excuses. And would expect him to do more physical activity for my father. Currently i can see an improvement in my father's health but its very slow. 

Also, it appears that he is on leave now and went to his hometown. He should have informed us earlier so that we were prepared and could have arranged for an alternative. But without our knowledge, he just disappeared and we are not sure when he will return. Or is he really going to come back. The coordinator whom i spoke to says he may take 10-15 days. Can you provide an exact date as to when he will return. We would like to continue his service. The current nurse attendant that you have sent, we do not like him. His service is not good and he has a laid back attitude. Please look into this matter.

Firstly, I was told that my treatment will start from today itself, but the physio told that 1st day its only for diagnosis & advice. Why did I pay Rs.400 to a physio just for advice?? Even best of orthopedic doctors charge Rs.300 here!!

Second, it is clearly mentioned in your email that each visit will be charged Rs.400, but the physio who visited said that charges will be Rs.500 to Rs.700 because of the distance he has to travel & the materials he may use. Every physio uses equipments & its included in the charges only, then why the extra charge???

Third, Mr. Sahajamal was also asking for 10days advance!!! No physiotherapist here asks for such advance!!!

If these are the rules & practices you follow, why wasn't I told all this over phone??? I wouldn't have agreed to such conditions at all!! Why this kind of cheating is going on???"

2363,104994,Mumbai,P,1,1,1,3,1,7,2,0,"We have lodged a complaint against Mr Biplab Bera vide complaint no 40674 dt 10th Sept'15 that he was very rude , non-co-operative and misbehaved with  76 yrs aged Mrs Anjali Das ,wife /of Mr Subodh Kr Das residing at 37/4 Sarat Ghosh Garden Road ,Dhakuria ,Kolkata-700031. Mr Bera was so much rude that he used to howl and shout whenever Mrs Anjali Das had some queries regarding the nursing of her husband ,Mr Subodh Kumar Das.Such was the audacity of Mr Bera that he took the house as his personal property and used to dictate Mrs Das to arrange for his food , washing clothes ,etc etc.
The supervisor ,Mr Jobin of Portea was adminstratively ineffective and was playing in the hands of the attemdants.Mr Jobin used to frequently change attendants at his own will being fully aware that the patient has suffered  cerebral stroke .Attendants were not trained to take care of such cerebral stroke patients .One Mr Pranab used to be on leave quite often for some reason or the other.Portea should seriously evaluate the skill of the attendants ."
2364,129324,Mumbai,P,1,4,1,1,NA,7,0,-2,"Dissatisfaction with the service is on two accounts.
1) The concerned physiotherapist arrived 15 mins late (which is not considered bad for Mumbai standards), took 15 mins to go through the papers of the patient & asked a few questions (which is natural as it was her first visit with the patent but only worked with the patent for 15 mins (of which a few mins were spent on attending personal calls).
A one hour session on the patent equaled to only 15 mins.
On checking with the physiotherapist on why only 15 mins of therapy to the patent her answer was the patent is unable to go through more.
Which I do not agree as I saw what therapy the patient was going through at the hospital (& now when we have called in another physiotherapist in place of the one you'll sent us.)  
Your physiotherapist spent a total of 30 mins at the residence of the patent only.  
2) Your charges of Rs 800 per session which was bought down to Rs. 700 per session on request equals to visits made at home from highly qualified physiotherapist from leading hospital of Mumbai.
In that case you'll loose out to any cost advantage to a patient."

3110,158556,Baroda,P,5,5,4,4,3,21,6,-4,"Hi,
We were initially quite happy with Portea's process for providing us nurse attendants within 24 hrs (started services on 23rd Jan) and also visiting us in the hospital with coordinator & attendants. And then the 2 nurse attendants Kavita and Pranita were also very good and capable, polite, helpful in the way they handled the patient (Mrs Basu, my mother). But after 3 days when the nurse attendant Kavita informed us about her leave plans for 3 days from 28th to 30th, the entire handling of providing substitute attendant and communicating with us about the same was a very bad experience. SInce Kavita had informed us of her plans in advance, on Monday 25th Jan itself I spoke to the coordinator and told him to let us know who would be the substitute nurse-attendant for those 3 days and ideally ask her to visit patient's residence 1 day prior to familiarise with the location. However till Wednesday 27th Jan when I still received no info on the substitute attendant, I kept calling the coordinator and sent him 2 SMSes to send me her profile details but got no response from him. Finally on 28th morning when even at 8:05am there was no substitute attendant at my mother's residence, I called up your 1800 number and lodged a complaint with your Call Centre. After that at 8:19am I got a Whatsapp msg from coordinator that one Ms SHobhana would be coming to our place; but even till 9:15am she had not reached. She called my father and told him that she was lost and hence delayed; so my father explained the route/location. Finally 2 attendants Shobhana and Anjana arrived at 9:30am; and after speaking to their boss, Ms Anjana stayed over as the attendant. I was shocked to learn from Anjana that she was informed only at 1am of 28th that she had to reach my Mom's place in the morning; hence she obviously saw the msg only in the morning after she woke up and hence got delayed. SO my disappointment with Portea is that even after informing you on Monday about 3 days leave by Kavita, why could you not make replacement arrangements well in advance? Especially why did you not communicate her profile and phone number atleast 1 day prior to me (I could have called her up and explained our location/route and hence avoided so much of anxiety on patient/relative's part? The coordinator gave me the excuse today morning that the Portea person responsible for providing the substitute had not informed him earlier and hence he could not return my calls or get back to me with profile details on 27th Jan!Now that is a very lame and ridiculous excuse which only proves that Portea's systems & logistics handling are really bad when even 2 staff members cannot coordinate with each other ! So overall quite disappointed with this lack of communication that Ive faced in the 1st week of my taking up Portea's services. I hope you will improve your process and that this will not be repeated again. I've mentioned all these facts to Mr Ranju of the Mumbai office and asked him to see that this doesn't get repeated after 2 days when the night attendant is planning to take leave."

Rajendra has been a super start for our family. He has been very helping , kind, considerate and available for my father ( Shashikant) at all times. He is very polite, listens and tries to understand the request and addresses it with utmost professionalism. There have been very difficult days we have been through and I would say Rajendra has been a rock solid support for us all this while

I highly recommend you please provide him with the best of the appraisal as he is the primary reason why I would refer Portea

With all my humility thank you

Which is really not worth at all.
Thanks

2) I didn't find first session that useful. I assumed that Physiotherapist will be more experienced given the medical condition of my mother but she was just ok. 
3) She didn't bring any instrument with her and was asking me if i have any spring ball etc so that she can show us how to use that. I expected her to carry all instruments required for session. 
4) She was hardly there for 30 mins whereas i was told that session would be of an hour. She explained just few basic exercises in first session and i believe Rs 500 is too much for that.
5) Dr called me on Wednesday to confirm the appointment and i asked her to give me some time as i was not satisfied with first session. But she tried to push me to confirm it by telling about cancellation charges and all which i didn't like. 
6) When i cancelled the appointment this morning, Dr called me and told that she has discussed my issue with portea team and they will now charge only Rs 400 per session. Well, not happy with this attitude as it shows that it is all about money and how to retail the patients and not about care. This also proves that you took extra money from me during first session.
7) I have found a physiotherapy center nearby where they have all the equipment and the charges are very less. Only Rs 250 per session. Also the physiotherapist is quite experienced lady (8+ years) and i think she can take better care of my mother."

We availed 24 hrs Nursing Service for my 3 months old baby as he had undergone surgery so we wanted trained and qualified nurse to look after my baby for few days. In the website they claim ""Our nurses are highly qualified. Most of them are ICU-trained."" by the fact is they are just attenders and not done any Nursing. They are Fake. Use the service at your own risk. Below is the list of complaint.

1) Makes more bottle feed(75 ml) even though we told to make 60 ml so Nurse can sleep more and avoid take care of baby. We have been told by doctor to give 60 ml.

2) Very un-hygiene.They use some face oil and just washes and uses feeding bottle without cleaning it thoroughly.

3) Always uses mobile near baby even though we told many times not to use mobile phone near baby.

4) Forcefully make baby sleep when he is in playful mood. So she can use mobile all the time.

5) Once she Hold my baby leg tightly and made him cry. We clearly saw the red mark in his leg.

6) Do not know to make formula milk and always tell lies. Makes 75 ml and tells us it is 60 ml. Also she first put powder and pores water and checks in hand instead of placing the empty bottle in the table, then put required amt of water and then add powder to get correct mixing. She does not care for baby health. So be careful if you have already hired.

7) Do not know how to bath a baby and handle roughly and make him cry.

8) Never listens to us. They dominate.

9) Even baby is crying, she feeds. Won't it get into his lungs?

10) One time she was sleeping holding my baby in hand. Just think what will happen! So beware! If you have already hired, do not leave your baby unattended at any cost."

She confirmed for one day, the message I got was for another day, no body came for 2 days and the 3rd day when I called they had no idea about my booking at all. 

Your technician who came to collect my blood sample had no awareness about cleanliness and how to draw a sample from a transplant patient. I had to educate him.

I did not get the printout of the reports in time and I had to make so much effort to get it printed and take it to my physician. It was a total pain and a messy affair.

There is no coordination between your front office, the lab and the technician who collects the sample.

I did not get a detailed break up of my bill.

Then he comes with another one and that one could not find his way from an apartment where he had worked to ours for forty minutes. One of the reasons for keeping an attendant is that my dad wanders or walks and my mom cannot keep pace with him but if he cannot find an apartment in forty minutes while having worked in the area how will he manage my dad and get him back home. Further on, your supervisor kept saying for everything ""its not my company"". For Arvind when I asked him why did you put a person who was not going to stay for more than a day , he said this person was not under him. A clear lack of ownership. Had they told me this guy cannot manage hence we are replacing , I would have understood. So, I discontinued because this person was completely lacking any accountability or ownership.

Firstly, the lady who was taking blood samples did not wipe the target area with acetone, but rather rubbed it with dry cotton and I had to tell her to put acetone in the cotton. 

Lastly, she lacked proper technique and struggled to draw blood even though my vein was clearly visible. This caused a lot of pain. This has been an issue with other people who attended the camp aswell.

I have given blood samples to other companies as well and Have never experienced such issues...
I hope that you will consider my feedback...

4007,175337,Bangalore,Phle,2,3,2,NA,4,11,5,9,"The very 1st day when we had asked for the assistant's services for 4 hours as a demo and thereafter for 8 hours (after confirming with one of the associates on phone), we were shocked to hear that the assistant would work only for 2 hours that day! However, we thought that's ok (we can adjust) and looked forward to Portea's services!

Also, all of Portea's rules/regulations weren't clearly explained to us viz. if an assistant would leave early then, for that time, Portea would compensate the parents. This rule was only explained to us and came in the picture after the 1st assistant had to be changed!!!! It seems that there are road-blocks at every junction from Portea's end which might require some introspection and deep analysis!!

We aren't being too critical here however, the points mentioned below are our observations.


Manjula is good in her work (adjustable with our food preparation style and never complains, gave us some tips for feeding the baby like modifying some food stuffs which were very helpful, ensures to remove evil eye without fail) and is loving as well however, she is adamant and doesn't budge. She would like to do things in her own way even if that means the baby is sleeping she would want to wash the clothes! Due to the noise, the baby might wake up and on explaining the above situation to her, she was adamant and almost rushed to wash the clothes against our opinion/request!!!

We also explained to her about our baby's feeding habits (might not take thick fluids as this fluid regime was just started) however, she was still adamant when explained by my mom-in-law and when the baby didn't take thick porridge, she prepared it less thick after which the baby gulped in quick time!!

On the very 1st day of her job she slept for an hour or so (we understand she travels from quite a far distance and might get tired as we all are humans so, not an issue). As a result, she couldn't boil the feeding bottles. Also, on one day she kicked the baby's soft toy (bunny rabbit) away from that place however, she apologized for this when we explained to her that our kid plays with that toy.

On one of the days, our kid fell from her lap while trying to undress/dress. Luckily the kiddo didn't get hurt and she also apologized. We also understand the fact that such a situation might occur with any of us!

We don't treat this people as maids rather they're like a family! Whatever we eat (including breakfast, morning and evening snacks, lunch, ice-creams) we ensure that they also eat the same; ensure that they eat first and then, we eat at the end after everyone has eaten; either my mom-in-law or myself are always around to give a helping hand so she doesn't have to do all the tasks alone; ensure that they also rest if the baby is resting and all the other tasks are completed, gave another set of dress as the baby might defecate/urinate and her dress shouldn't get spoilt.


She goes a bit overboard and resorts to personal questions like -

a) From how many years are we married,
b) How was our child born,
c) After how many years our child was born,
d) Our house maid comes at what time and our association with her is from how many years,
e) Tasks to be assigned to our maid (we have to decide or an outsider has to decide that!!!!!),
f) What time our friends are visiting our home,
g) Asking my mom-in-law's personal mobile no. to talk,
h) Wanted to play on my mom-in-law's Apple Ipad, etc.


Also, erroneously she failed to notice today that (perhaps due to oversight) the bedsheet (on which we keep the baby rather on the mattress directly) was wet and the water added in the baby's milk was boiling hot. Good that we noticed this or else the baby would have got burns on the tongue or even caught cold! What's the point of having an assistant if one needs to constantly observe minute things or keep an eye on when the assistant has spend approx. 2 weeks or so????????

Manjula isn't punctual as she reports after 9:00 am however, she writes the punch-in time as 8:55 am daily (is it possible to have the same punch-in time?????? We can understand that we might take the same bus/cab daily which we all do for our office work; however, daily in time of 8:55 am was consistently observed!! The bus driver deserves credit here as he is more professional and a perfectionist than your team!!!!!!!) in her log book which is good 10-15 mins less and this happens everyday as per our observation from 2 days! This came into limelight today as smartly she wasn't showing us the punch-in time till now by folding her log book!!! Also, she left at 6:55 pm on 8Mar'16 and didn't give/instruct my husband to sign against that day. She took my signature the next day for the previous day so, that one doesn't check the logout time for the previous day. Also, she didn't allow and refused me to sign against today's log saying that ""you might be tired, so you rest and we can sign on Monday"". The intention might be good however, due to previous experience regarding her timings, we're of the opinion that she might be thinking that we might forget easily about her punch-in and logout timings!!! A smart cookie, isn't it???????

She ensures that she would leave by 6:55 pm (as she would reach home late, which is fine and not a concern) however, what about the missing minutes (she said she would compensate everyday by extending 5 mins however, we are yet to observe that)??? Counting last Tuesday (8Mar'16) and today's (12Mar'16) less time of 30 mins (15 mins x 2), this might come as 90 mins in a week (average 15 mins x 6 days)! Who's going to compensate us for that? 

We had good expectations from Portea as we had availed physiotherapy services earlier. We aren't expecting services at the drop of a hat as we are not PM/CM/VVIP's; however, you're charging a bomb (which we're paying from our hard earned white money) for your services so, at least we expected some professionalism which isn't observed!! This kind of attitude and approach isn't positive and promising.

This is the 2nd instance wherein an assistant was changed due to long distance and problems with an earlier assistant. Why doesn't Team Portea isn't proactive, plan properly and ensure that such episodes shouldn't recur Why does one need to react and search for a solution only after the milk has spoilt/damage has been done??? If the assistant isn't available, please let us know and we would start searching for an alternative as the only difference between Portea and people from outside is that the former speaks English and seems to be professional however, the situation is reversed here!!!!!!

Also how many chopping and changes does one need to do for the right assistant? When would our baby adjust to your assistants (as each have their own unique style and our kid is just 7 months old) if they are changed like we change our handkerchiefs daily!!!!

We would like to get our money back as we definitely aren't satisfied with the services provided!!!

Hope to receive a positive response from your end or else we might have to go for a legal opinion against your team for mental harassment, unprofessionalism and negligence.

This isn't a threat or a warning but, do try to understand our situation from parent's point of view as well! Also, this isn't the 1st time some of the scenarios have been occurring!!!"

The supervisor, does not come to check and comes only to take the money. TODAY THE ATTENDANT HAS NOT COME AND THERE IS A CRISIS AT HOME. PLEASE SEND A REPLACEMENT IMMEDIATELY. Kamal the supervisor who signed the contract with us is not reachable on mobile since morning.

Simply wasted 6000 rs for a month whereas same physio done at Hosmat Hospital within 10 says able to bend 120 degree where as Mr.Ejaz  hardly 30 degree for one month.
Hope so I get atleast half the money back what I have paid  if you people really wanted to really good  to people and do good business be honest and plz for God sake be honest and not grab money unwantedly"

But the staff Ms.Uma who is now coming for the service, doesn't want to take any directions from me or my mother and wants to do things her way in caring for the babies. If we tell her anything to do this way, she gets irritated and shouts. She sleeps every day and when I told her not to sleep she is shouting and telling ""I will anyway get my salary, I don't need to come to your house, I will get another house, you go find someone else for your babies."" When I take service from a person and that person blackmails me, I feel helpless as a mother. All methods have been tried - talking politely, talking moderately and finally talking strictly. All she says is ""I will leave and go"".
We give her more than adequate fresh lunch, coffee and sometimes evening snacks also, and never have treated her as an outside person. But we feel she is exploiting us."

On the last day when I terminated service the Attender did not report to work and neither I got any call from Portea and finally I gave up and stopped the service.

After paying an exorbitant amount as demanded, as high as 19,000/- PM, what we get is  service not worth the amount.  Totally unprofessional... Attendants walk in without ICards, without a uniform.  Their hygiene is a big zero,. When we very rightfully ask for their ICards, we are invariably told that PORTEA has not allotted one and a uniform is also awaited.  We are left with no other option but to accept this indiciplined method of PORTEA. May I ask, who is to be blamed if the attendant turns out to be a fraud??? Does PORTEA vouch for him,  his integrity?? No background check is conducted... So much so,  we have to helplessly depend on PORTEA, and keep the  attendant in our house for eight long hours...Think PORTEA needs to revamp the whole setup for better services to their client."

Too over priced for the mediocre quality of service. The role of the coordinator was less said the better. My experience is that you are not providing a service to senor citizens but trying to get school kids to work with no work experience with nil skill building."

At the time of placing the request we were asked<U+00A0> regarding our language preference and we had asked for someone speaking Malyalam or Hindi as my mother is more comfortable with this.

On the 11th your coordinator Mr Raja brought one Ms Chaya for the night shift. She changed into a nighty as soon as she came in, spread a bedsheet on the floor and was fast asleep by 10 pm. She said rhat they have been instructed to sleep whenever possible. My mother is a critical heart patient who is on 24 hour oxygen and we need someone to monitor her continuously. When we told her to sit on a chair to keep an eye on her, Ms Chaya promptly put her head on the patients bed and went off to sleep. In the morning she refused to take the patient for a short walk inside the room.

The next day we lodged a complaint with both Mr. Raja and the customer service helpline, but neither of them could resolve the matter. We did not have anyone<U+00A0> on the night shift since 12th. Another lady who was sent yesterday too did not meet our requirements.

We are very disappointed by the poor quality of staff sent by you despite paying premium charges.

We will not be paying for the services rendered by Ms Chaya as our family members looked after my mother as she was sleeping through the night.

Please let us know whether you can provide people who are used to night shifts and will monitor my mother keeping awake through the nights and give a consistent service."

In actual practice, nothing of such happens in Portea's case. Physio comes, talks nicely about historical aspect, makes the patient do some exercises and that's about it. He/she does not even touch the patient, leave aside giving any treatment.
If only the exercise were the cure, why would  we go to a physio?
This is my opinion, not necessarily correct or binding."

The attendants are not properly trained and most of them have an attitude and are very proud in talking or dealing with patients or other family. They think they are doctors and know everything. They do not learn about patient health, schedule of work , or medicines. They are more like labour who mechanically do things without thinking. They cannot even repeat exercises. mR. GAURAV WAS THE WORST IN ATTITUDE AND T5RIED TO DISTURB OUR DOMESTIC STAFF BY OFFERING JOBS IN pORTEA AND THAT HE WOULD HELP.

Your system of coordinator is not working properly. They do not talk to attendant or client daily or once in a couple of days if the service is good, timely, etc. They sanction long leave to attendants without even informing client and WHEN WE ASK WHY THIS HAPPENED, they say we will provide substitute. The onus of training each attandant is on the client. You shd treat client as more important than the attendant or coordinator and train them that for Portea , client satisfaction is more important than aNYTHING ELSE BEC.

- there was a prescription suggested by Dr. Ballal that I shared with the call centre executive based on which I signed up for the plan!

I really don't expect any department call as I am not going to reuse the services in future of going to refer anyone for the same.

She was smelling badly and also did not have any experience at all. She went to sleep after having her food. At night, when the patient wanted to use bed pan, she called out thrice to her but she did not wake up. She rung a bell which we had given her in case of emergency, but yet she did not  wake up. On hearing the bell, my aged father got up. He too shouted to wake up Salma but she did not get up. I, her son, got up on hearing my father shouting. I then went next to   Salma and shouted loudly, only then she got up. Our whole house had to get up just to wake up your attendant. Did she come to our house just to sleep???"

5570,194937,Nagpur,P,4,5,4,NA,NA,13,7,2,"Deepak is a very polite, pleasant and presentable young man. He was willing to learn, very obliging and followed instructions closely.

However, there are some general observations i would like to share about Portea's services.

1) When i approached Portea, i was given to understand that all the attendants are highly trained and experienced. Yet, i was surprised to learn that the training is provided to attendants on dummies, and therefore, attendants are often raw and inexperienced when it comes to handling real life patients and situations.

2) Portea does not seem to have imparted to trainees a standard hygiene protocol, such as using gloves while cleaning the private parts of patients after they have urinated or passed stools; washing hands; use of wet wipes; use of underpads etc. 

3) The attendants do not seem to have been trained to operate even the simplest of hospital beds. They have little understanding of  management of patients who are confined to their beds - including turning them efficiently and painlessly; correcting/adjusting their postures when they have slid down the bed, or when they need to be fed.

4) It is extremely difficult for anyone to sustain a 12 hour shift for extended durations. Portea must build into their system a mechanism for substitution such that it does not inconvenience the client. Therefore, instead of adhoc absenteeism, every attendant should be given a day off every week or once every 10 days. However, the substitute should be oriented by the regular attendant, and not the client, as happened in our case...the one day that Deepak was absent, i had to cancel all my prior engagements for that day as the substitute, Anand, was unfamiliar with my father's routine and i had to spend the entire day overseeing him.

5) It is my suggestion that before an attendant is placed, the Portea supervisor and attendant must make a home visit and study the patient's routine carefully and work out with the client the hourly requirements. Portea must understand all the grooming, medication, bed management and other issues and requirements and ensure that the attendant being assigned has the requisite experience, maturity and confidence to fulfil the patients/client's needs.  

6) Attendants must be given strict instructions to keep their use of the mobile phone to a minimum.  

I would like to conclude by saying that none of the above comments are a reflection on Deepak or his performance. They are instead pointers to some gaps and shortcomings in Portea's training process.

Really appreciate Dr Fathima for her service which she has rendered to my mother.

Thanks

5649,49234,Bangalore,NA,4,3,4,NA,3,14,5,-8,"My assessment is that this organisation is running at the whims of Coordinators. there is no check on them to see if they are arranging N/ A keeping in view the need of consumer and the interest of company. I have been getting service from this company for more than one year and I have been pointing out to one problem and it remains the same, it arises when ever N/As Martha and Aarti go on leave or I go to Noida to my daughter's house although I am assured that there would not be any problem in sending N/A to Noida.
 Last time,I was assured from Madam Aishwarya that  there would be no problem in sending N/A to Noida  although Coord Deepak showed his inability to send N/A there. I conveyed my thanks and expressed my gratitude to her for offering the services at Noida and also conveyed to her that I had arranged one since coord  Deepak had not assured me of providing N/A at Noida. I expressed my surprise and shared it with her also then. My surprise was that Coord Deepak was not interested in Revenue of the company  but in his own convenience of arranging N/A at Noida. Professionalism demands that customer needs must be fulfilled even at his own cost but it was not attitude of the coord. I told him if he could arrange N/A at Noida or I may arrange for myself. He was happy to listen that I can arrange myself and he agreed to my suggestion where as her attitude was the opposite one that she came voluntarily to arrange for N/A at odd hours.
On 26th April, 2016 I informed Coord Deepak that Martha was going on leave on 29th and 30th April, 2016 and I would be going to Noida at my daughter<U+0092>s house.  I also suggested him that I would take N/A Seema ( He informed me that Seema would come on 29th & 30 th April on day duty when Martha would go on leave ) along with me when she would come to Janak puri at 8.00am and he may direct Aarti ( who is coming already at night duty) to reach Noida for night duty. But he did not agree to my suggestion and told me that he would arrange someone from Noida. I agreed to it although it remains problematic with new comer. On 28th April I again reminded him if he had arranged  someone from Noida. He assured me that I would get. I made him clear that I would not be able to carry on with Seema if she continued 29th morning , then 29th evening and then 30th morning as it is not possible for N/A to continue for such long hours without rest. If it is done I would be taxed and I would have to do much of the work since she is not so efficient and also not having rappo with patient. Since I am an old man it would not be possible for me to share work with her at night then in the day next day. He told me that he would send another one from Noida. But on 29th evening at 7.00pm he called me & informed that Seema would continue at night and then next morning. I talked to Seema about it and she expressed her inability but she could not refuse coord and it is why she accepted it. Since she was tired in day duty as patient condition is such that she gives less time for her rest. I told her to go home and I called Coord to arrange another one but he declined. He neither agreed to direct Aarti to reach Noida although she was not allotted  any work on that night nor he arranged another one. With the result I had to manage myself at night and there was no N/A on 29th evening. It is evident this organization runs on the whims of coordinator not on the principle of professionalism. On One side ,Aarti was given salary for no work on that day and on the other, organization had to lose revenue since no one was provided to me and I had to look after the patient at night. I wonder if there is any check on the whims of coordinator. Is anyone held responsible for the loss of organization and for the inconvenience of customer just to keep the ego of coordinator? In simple words Aarti could be deputed to Noida and she had no problem in coming since she had been there already but it was not acceptable to Coordinator.
Since Madam Aishwarya had allowed me on previous occasion on phone that I can approach her with my problem without hesitation I put forward my view points to her but I did not get any feedback. On 14th May,2016 I planned to go to Noida and I informed coordinator about it. I also requested that Aarti ( who is coming for night duty )may be directed to come to Noida. He told me that he would arrange from Noida as it would be very far off for Aarti. I agreed to get N/A ( new one ) from Noida. To my surprise N/A on that night came from much farther from Azadpur. She came from a distance much more than what Aarti ( who was coming on night duty earlier ) would have traveled and again she ( Aarti ) was not sent for another duty. Again loss to revenue since coordinator was not interested in sending Aarti to Noida as he had already refused and ego was working and not company, interest.
I have all praise for Martha Horro N/A. She is very sincere and devoted to her duty. She is very punctual and knows her job very well. She has a good rappo with the patient and understands her problems. Since patient has been on bed for more than one year and she gets irritated without any cause but Martha handles her nicely. I wish her success and may God bless her.

Belamati was TERRIBLE. 
1. She put her foot on the edge of my mom's cot and continuously spoke on the mobile phone
2. She would be continuously texting
3. She did not know how to provide a bed pan and blamed my mother instead.

I had to sack her the same day - 19th May, within a few hours.

Portea has no control over its attendants. Lakshmi, the first attendant was extremely good & caring. But when she asked to go on leave, she played games, saying one day, then two days, then one week.

Portea's training of its staff is not able to ensure that there is CONSISTENCY. Lakshmi was good. Belamati was very bad.

Hiring of O2 cyclinder etc., was an ORDEAL. No one knows how to operate them.

Shaju - male medical nurse was VERY GOOD.

We paid for 15 days, but used attendant services only for 11 days.

There was no hold procedure followed, this is worse than any horrible customer service ever. then you guys kept asking me for payment a million times, kept sending me payment links, all those people who came home kept asking for payment inspite of making the payment within minutes of sending the payment link the first time.  I had to then make 6 calls and some 10 tickets to get the issue sorted. now also I have no idea when the reports will come, what you're going to do with etc., no clue.

She used to limp even after the knee replacement and unfortunately had developed an infection and was operated again due to which we completely stopped the physio therapy. But then opted for Portea and Dr.Chetan has been a god send person for my mother and has helped her recover so well and walk in a much better way. We never expected such dramatic improvement just by physio therapy but certainly this has been a eye opener for us and my mother and father are grateful from bottom of their heart to Dr.Chetan,
He is very systematic, patient, observant, caring and sincere.
He is very knowledgeable about the various exercises and conditions.
If required again, we would like to avail his serices, in fact we asked for him after seeing his demo class about 4 months back.

I am extremely sorry for submitting the feedback a bit late as we were also waiting for CPM sessions, He was the one who suggested such a treatment for my mother and we would like to thank him for suggesting us (just that it would have been nice to have the machine earlier when he was doing the physio therapy for my mother) as were not aware of this. It has immensely helped my mother."

She is Muscle dystrophy patient.  As a person he was good, but does not seem to have much experience . He did some streching, almost pulling the leg and hand too much,which resulted in lot of pain to her.
Her ankle had a fracture last year, even it was given a bad strech which, resulted in lot of pain to her. Therefore, it was overall a bad experience.
this can cause lot of damage to her muscles, so please check the experience of the physiotherapist, whether he/she has any idea about the  disease. Otherwise you are causing more damage to the patient. I had lot of expectations from portea, but was disappointed."

With the coordinator Rajeev's help, we had him replaced with Dhani Debbarma who is much better. I have positive feedback on him but the experience with Somesh was very bad. Please make sure he understands his job and shows some empathy towards the patient."
6205,72518,Bangalore,NA,4,4,5,4,2,19,5,1,Providing cash bill to me getting late every time when i use homecare blood tests on the day of appointments with Dr. Kishore Babu. Earlier Ms.Ashwini takes personal care to handover the bill on same day but nowadays its horrible. For instance i came for monthly test on 4th June. Today is 13th but so far i havnt got the bill which i have to claim next day of my visit. I was told by the counter persons that bill will be late by two hours due to the person who was not submitted the same. We cant wait another two hours after our appointment. So i told them one of my dialysis friend will come pl handover the same. But the same reply was given to him on 11th June that ' can u pl wait one more hour'. They does again and again when we ask they say 'extremly sorry'. Again they continue the same practice.

One, when I took the appointment, the customer care rep told me that I would get the report after 24 hrs. But when I didnt get the report in that time, I called the customer care again. I was rudely informed that the report will be available only after 24-36hrs. I expected Portea to be transparent regarding all these things.
Next, the person who had come to collect the blood sample, was not efficient enough. He took the blood sample from the back of the palm. It was taken in such a bad way that it hurt terribly. The sample was collected on June 7th. Till date there is a dark black mark all around that prick area and it is hurting a lot. So, I suggest Portea to do something about this as well.

I guess feedback required is for ""12Hr Nursing Attendant with Ms. Sushila Lakra "" and not for portea services.

Hence I would like to mention separately that Sushila Lakra work is  Excellent and she is very punctual, dedicated, quick learner, and ready to adapt with the changing nature of patient and she is awesome.

She helped me to handle my Mom till her last breath.

Thanks alot Sushila Lakra

Rest all your Nursing attend were bit Careless. now you all can check who all nursing attendant has worked for us. Some were sleeping, some give back answer to patient when patient is medically irritated. some after giving training also do not know how to remove urine from urine bag (I have to teach them) some take a chair seat in balcony and sleep tight we have to wake them up in day time too. some do not know the difference between Jet and flush. assuming jet as a flush they pressed it and patient bed was wet. This is the service you provided us.

Now think for a while after reading this how would you like to rate your service.?  Aslo when Sushila health was not well your portea could not able to provide a single good backup. after giving continuous feedback.at last they said you have only these option and i have to adjust with that.(in that case will you adjust with the charges which you ask as to pay)

Now let me know, In such cases how I should recommend your service to other. although I have given a nice feedback to your customer who were asking me about your service. but I still scare to give wrong feedback. because only one best employee cannot represent the whole company."

I'm asking you to send a trained medical professional. Finally a nurse turned up one hour late and he too seemed unsure of what he had to do.

6357,180036,Bangalore,P,5,5,4,1,2,17,4,3,The attendant staff should be trained in much better way. They should make patient do things like routine work etc. Most of the attendants who came were behaving more like scared servant rather than attendant. Patient will be irritated as he is a patient. How attendant deals with him in polite manner and make him do things that patient might be ignoring due to illness is attendant job. Attendant are not servants who sit ideal in front of patient and do only what patient says. Attendant's should have the confidence and should be trained enough to help patient get back to his normal life. Attendant service required in our case is because father is going into depression due to illness. And he has stopped doing his routine work. We need an attendant who can help him n make him do all his routine work again. After opting your service with about 15change of attendants my father has stopped walking as he is a rt mca patient. Walking is a must for him. He has stopped coming out of his room. Don't know if any of your attendant is talented and trained enough to handle his anger at the same time help him bring back to his normal routine. Befire we opted for your service I and my husband used to make him do all activities. Hoping his condition does not detoriate and he gets back to his normal routine. Don't want a dominating attendant but a friendly attendant for him. We may need attendant service for long term may be more than a year. Request to help us get some concession and a good trained and talented staff.

The woman sent to attend to her is Kaushalya alias Kajal who comes with two cell phones and is on her phones the whole time and DOES NOT attend to the patient Mrs. Usha Shah at all. The patient was in the bathroom yesterday and had a fall and the woman went away without even helping her at 7:30 whereas her 12 hours were ending at 8:30 pm.
We are most dissatisfied with the woman named Kajal and recommend immediate sacking of Gaurav in the interest of your company's reputation.
Please understand that we are going to take up the matter at the highest level and with the Government of India for negligence of your staff and for deficiency of promised service after collecting payment.
Meanwhile we request that Soniya may be reinstated to attend to Mrs. Shah who is 90 years old and has now developed a level of confidence with her.

A few days ago, my 95 yr old father was admitted with a massive stroke. After a week in hospital, I decided to take him home. I approached the Portea Counter in our hospital, who promised me that they would provide 12 hourly Trained attendants at home to look after my unconscious father, at a fairly steep charge.

On taking my father home, I have been provided with two completely inexperienced girls who have had 15 days training. They do not know how to check oxygen saturation, perform suction and even clean out the mouth of the patient. None of them has any Basic Life Support Training. On trying to contact your local representative repeatedly, Mr Nibarun Saha, I got no response to my calls or SMS. He called me up about 6 hours later saying that because of Ramzan, he was unable to provide experienced staff. However, this was not mentioned to me earlier. Neither were the charges altered to suit the level of experience. And care does not stop be it Ramzan, Christmas or Diwali.

I have had a horrible experience dealing with your organisation. Not only am I not going to refer anyone else to Portea, I will go to consumer court to ensure you are unable to provide young totally inexperienced girls for home nursing care. I think you web site is full of inaccuracies. Please rest assured that I will pursue this on social media too, so that others like me are not duped by your company. 

Finally, I would suggest you get rid of Mr. Nibarun Saha in Kolkata immediately.
