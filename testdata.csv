I am personally very happy but for small issues which really tend to come in the irritation zone which your Ops team need to understand and sort but unfortunately we customers are made to go through this . Recent incidence of replacement are issue , taking off without notice is issue the night duty person refusing to wash clothes and pushing the burden on morning duty person why should I deal with all these? I have paid in advance and expects flawless service . I should know upfront with photo ID proof as to who comes in replacement but till last minute it's a mystery and can be a security threat as no one from Portea accompanies. I would like to talk to someone senior in management to give my feedback as the service post my feedback to dr Devyani has deteriorated which is not acceptable .

Quality time and attention given by the doctor itself heals half the issue. 

The only thing I see is that we are not sure how experienced are the doctors who are visiting. 

it will be better when your confirming the doctor and sending the details if you can metion the experience they carry and their specility it will be more comforting.

The girls on duty reached us in time in the morning (8:00 a.m.).  However they wanted to leave early in the evening.  

I had to reprimand one girl as I found her with her legs up on the patient's bed.  The girls were polite and seemed to be trained.  but these little things mentioned above were not expected.  

i was told the money paid earlier would be refunded in case of non use by the family.  i have not heard from the coordinator.

With this info only i continued my communication but last min i was told sych service is not available. Regarding slots and pricing i was from start told about monthly packages for 4 hrs ,8 hrs, 12 hrs and 24 hrs but at the time of finalizing slot i was told no 8 hrs package available. These finer details(confusion about attendent and slot availability kind of made me not sign up for any monthly deal and i thought of checking for couple of days. As mentioned Gulaabjaan was excellent with vihaan and i really felt if she was an attendent as told by sylvia i would have signed up for monthly package irrespective.This was purely because gulaabjaan impressed me  but if i have to talk about communication with portea staff i was higly confused and in fact lil disappointed. At the same time as u have asked about feedback on refering to a friend or family, i will recommend u only if someone needs a nurse for there kids.

My second week experience with Portea was worst, especially last two days. Three attendants were changes in 7 days by Portea. 

1. How do you expect that patient and family members would be able to adapt to that, as well as Nurse attendant to the patient. Nurse needs to understand patient's needs and behaviour.

2. Attendants were in uniform for just a couple of days (out of total 14 days experience).

3. The attendant deployed on 14th day (last day) was highly ill-mannered (didn't know how to behave with elderly people), not focused, very loud while talking to family members, etc.

4. Most of the times they were on their mobile phones, whole day using power points to charge their phones, etc.

5. Portea claims offering 4-hours services as well, but I was completely denied services without quoting any reason, then why do you advertise it.

6. Overall experience: hesitant in using Portea services next time.

7. Offering food to attendant is not at all logical, it's an headache. People are already so disturbed and fatigued seeing their dear ones suffering, and to lessen the burden we look for services, and your policy actually adding to the burden.

8. No use of this feedback system, I had reported earlier too, there was no response and no improvement. You should instead stop this.

9. I was asked for full advance payment, whereas, it was mentioned in your email 50% advance and 50% later. Obviously, one would lose faith in your system and your words.

Sorry, to mention all above, but you need to improve. You claim to be professionals, but you need to look into your deliverables and conduct. You are not at all leaving good impressions around.

3. At multiple instances, I was overcharged by the sample collector even though I explained that price he is asking is wrong.Utimately I had to complain to get back the extra amount through personally visiting home care.
4. The worst experience was at the last service where the sample wad taking but sent to wrong department for testing.Ultimately got call from Manipal to give sample again.This is stupid to keep giving multiple sample for a test.

We asked Banu Priya through the coordinator, Pridvi, who confirmed that she was not interested in working anymore. Now, since we have moved to Pondicherry, and you have no services here, we have made some local arrangements for my mother.
All in all, you have a very good setup, though there are gaps in some processes here and there. But, the issue that is likely tone faced by many patients is that your attendants want a change in work profile after a while. This should be checked proactively within your system, rather than patients suffering because of reduced efforts or demotivated efforts by your staff. 
Please look into it.
Thanks for the services for last few years; my mother really benefitted from your company's service. Wishing you all the best.

The Nursing attendant did not arrive on the last day i.e 2 Sep as he was unwell ( I was informed by Mr Gogoi, the attendant) but there was no action taken by Portea to send a relief or even inform me.

I was promised that the itemized invoice would be sent to email id immediately and Portea will get back to me on the missing tests. 2 days lapsed and there was no signs of either invoice or update on missing results.

The FIeld Officer has not even come once for his fortnightly visit (with me present) to check on the patient care and collect feedback. This was assured would happen. Even when the nurses change he doesn't show up. He informs me via text on the day the event happens instead of calling and discussing with me. Some of the nurses meted rough treatment to the patient and there was no opportunity to address my grievance as I had no Field Officer or Supervisor to fall back on.

The only prompt service is your finance team either calling or sending an email for me to pay the bill. Kudos! And ofcourse, raising the physiotherapy charges was really helpful. (That's sarcasm if you dont get it)

Beggars cant be choosers but this beggar is shelling 900 + 450 per day (attender+physio) to Portea. And one last thing. If the Field Office engages in direct conversation with anyone but me on anything, Portea can collect the fees from whoever the Field Officer is speaking to.

There was a lady - Radha who was assigned to us by Ms Chitra who, I assume, is the local coordinator for Portea services in Mumbai.

In these two months of service beginning from 18 or 19 July 2016, there have been several instances of the service provider being absent or unable to come for the service with another being a 10 days leave during Ganapati festival and the coordinator failing to provide a suitable replacement leaving us high and dry. In other instances, while we had fixed the time for service at 10 AM, it was hardly seen that the service provider came on time. This heavily affected our schedule for the baby who needs to be massaged, bathed and fed on time and one cannot wait for the service provider for eternity. 

Even today the service provider was late citing reason of not getting a bus while other maids in my home reached right on time.

When the coordinator was called, she had the audacity of telling us that she will only provide the service provider lady for all balance days and will not renew the contract any further!!!!!!!

This is the level of arrogance and appalling degree of attitude which your coordinators carry!!

I put it on record that I am not going to recommend Portea services to any of my acquaintances in the future and also seek the refund of the payment already made to Portea for the days when the services have not been provided and till the last date of our contract.

The agreement is for 12 hours and the current one is about barely 9 to 9.5 hours daily which translates to 2.5 hour lesser worn  translating to 60 hours of less work which means effectively 5 days of work for which I pay but  in the pretext  of long distance  travel we are being given lesser service so the price should reflect the same or Portea should provide transport support . Plus very little flexibility by caretaker so please reduce the price for 5 days with immediate effect . 

Plus the additional  cost of breakfast and lunch . Bangalore service is way poorer than Delhi something the team in Bangalore should really learn the best practises . The distances were equally far but the commitment and service flexibility was far more 

Needs improvement . Please call me for specifics

19/09/2016: We were referred by a senior doctor at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata to take your professional services. We hired your services as on the above mentioned dates. After having a formal conversation and confirmation, the services were scheduled for 8pm, 20th September.
20/09/2016: The Team Lead arrives at the scheduled time. To our surprises, you guys had appointed a 20 year old kid who hardly has any knowledge on medical assistance as a attendant for a 26 year old patient who was discharged from hospital after staying there for a month time under ventilation and coma ! The same attendant after playing around with his cell-phone during duty, sleeps off to a extent that he wouldn't get up for assistance. We raised a issue and the team lead guaranteed to assist us with professional and better services from next day onwards
21/09/2016: A new attendant joins in after shift change. To our surprise, it's a 21 year old kid once again who doesn't know to read out temperatures from a thermometer, read out medicines and electronic blood pressure measuring systems. Seriously ? Another kid arrives as attendant to our services post the 12 hour shift change. Surprised yet ?
22/09/2016: After series of follow-ups, you guys arranged a professional attendant to our help. The did their job well for the next 2 days till morning shift of 24/09/2016. Take my feedback, they really helped a lot in patient's recovery.
24/09/2016: I guess it was time for you guys to come back to reality once again. You guys replaced the night attendant with a kid who was suffering himself with harsh cold and flu. Are you guys irresponsible enough to send a infected attendant to a rescue of a patient who had high grade pneumonial fever and chest infections earlier during his stay at hospital ? Everyone in the family had to stay awake the entire night for the sake of supervision.
It's time for you to wake up and better up your services if it means health care  assistance. You guys are foolishly playing around with the life of person at risk. Be professional at your services or just stay out of it without endangering lives. I am looking for a dignified answers to the series of flaws undertaken by your company. Please refrain from convincing talks without positive actions undertaken."

Of 3 therapists that were assigned to us, all had different lines of treatment, different levels of skill and professionalism with no link from one to the next. We did not think Dr. Vivek was very good in understanding and responding to the problem i.e. purely in terms of technical response, he was average. Dr. Aditya, who was assigned to us previously, was much better, but was not available later due to other engagements. Dr. Rajesh assigned somewhere in the middle was poor on both accounts - technical skill and professionalism. You probably need to address the technical skill level of staff also as it varies significantly from one person to the next."

When it suits them they work for you and quit and join another service provider when it does not.  Basically I found that Care 24 sent attendants who were cheats, and thieves who stole a lot of things from my house and cheated me of money, besides being highly unreliable in attendance.  When I complained. the company was not willing to take any responsibility and the employees just quit from their service.  In your case, the first attendant you supplied, Manoj, attended for 3 days and absented himself without notice on the fourth day. My advice would be, for you to train them first, make them sign some sort of contract to bind them to you and penalise them when they fail to carry out their duties as required by you.

These comments are intended to be constructive feedback and are intended to help you improve your fledgling enterprise into India's most valued at-home services. 

Observation: All your drawbacks seem to be process & people related. No differant from that faced by the customer-support BPO sector that your CEO knows better than anyone else.

1 Pls note that you address all communication to the 81-year old patient rather than to the family member who contracted for your services. Can the patient provide you feedback?

2 Your co-ordinators absolutely suck. I am sorry but there is no other way to describe their language skills. They are not fluent in English, Hindi or Marathi and are supporting people in Maharashtra. Secondly they simply do not return calls or acknowledge sms. 

3 Your nursing-aide staff needs better training to assure a basic minimum uniformity. I have so far used 5 differant aides. They can be rated as follows:

Sangeeta Pawar --- excellent. Not so much for medical training but for empathy to patient, pro-activeness in looking after patient comfort and reliability and punctuality.

Archana --- average to good. Used only once.

Manda--- horrible.

Ashwini--- good for medical training. But does not appear confident or pro-active.

Jaya --- good.

4. Every single time a substitute or nursing aide comes for the first time, they arrive at least 30-45 minutes late. Too late to take hand off from the night attendant. You need to do a better job of providing them directions to client residence.They need to understand that they need to budget extra time the first time.

5. I am sure all the above can be fixed but biggest aggravation is the co-ordinator.

6. You billing system needs to be better co-ordinated with operations.

Lastly, i hope this helps. Like I said at the start your service is invaluable but if you do not improve competition is barking at your heel. 

Regards"

The camp was supposed to get over at 11:30AM. I reached there with my husband for physiotherapy session and cholesterol check at around 11AM only to realise that the physiotherapy person had left earlier. We proceeded towards getting our BP checked and after several attempts to do the same we were told that the BP machine was not working. HIllarious! Finally we gave our blood samples, made the payment and came back. Now when our reports came two days later it was shocking to see that my husband's gender was mentioned as ""female"" and his name was mentioned as Mrs. Ankur Pahariya. This incident combined with our experience during the camp made us completely  loose faith in your professional standards, your services and the proficiency of your staff members. Extremely disappointing. Please raise your standards and hire your staff properly to remain competitive in the market."

Instead of assisting her when my mother  was performing the excercises, she was just busy on her mobile and texting others. This is very unprofessional. I dont expect to pay 500 Rs for a half hour session and then expect the doctor to be busy on her phone. She did not even bother to correct my mothers posture when she was imbalanced. 

Hence we have decided to stop this service. I would even actually ask for a refund of my money for the last session.

This did not happen. When I asked the physio she told there is no treatment on first visit. I told her that I was informed that the first visit includes one hour treatment.  She point blank told it is not true and she start treatment only from next visit.
Obviously your customer person has lied about the first visit...sort of business gimmick which is unethical. I am also a  doctor I felt bad about this.
However I m happy about the treatment.

Starting with feedback for Ms. Poonam, I would like to mention that she has rarely stuck to the given timings and is late almost on daily basis. This has also led to issues with other attendants who cover the other 12 hrs service. Further, she didn't turn up one day at all. 
I would also like to give general feedback to Portea, with the expectation that the service improves. 
1. The attendants, as told to us are trained; however, do not follow the proper steps for maintaining patient hygiene. They have to be repeatedly told to wear gloves and clean properly. Their negligence has even led to my grandmother being diagnosed with UTI(Urinary Tract Infection) again.
2. There is no code that restricts them to limit their time on mobile phones. They use their mobiles even when they are feeding the patient or when the patient is taking rest. One of the attendants would just leave the room to use the phone and had to be called back again and again when my grandmother needed her. 
3. My grandmother needs attention during the night as well, most of the times after every hour or so. The night attendants (Ms. Poonam is one of them) would doze off to sleep. As a result, my grandmother would be calling out for them at least 4-5 times before they take the trouble to wake up and attend to my grandmother.
4. There is no monitoring or oversight by local Portea Coordinators. Sometimes the appointed attendant would just take a break and send another attendant on duty and the Nursing coordinator is not even aware of this fact. I have raised all the issues with them. Often the attendants are just given mild reprimand based on my feedback. However, we continue to face the above issues with almost all the attendants. 
 
Given the wide reach of Portea, we expect better service from them.

I am also informed by him that the uniform provided to him consists of a half sleeves shirt and trousers. The shirt is small in size for him and he has been asked to 'make-do' with it for the time being.

I would normally not intervene in such matters as this is an internal issue, but I find this to be highly exploitative if true and I would be wary of using the services and/or recommending a company that exploits its employees. 

He leaves his place of residence at 6am on a glass of milk. Do you expect these people to help patients if they themselves are ill-fed? Also you cannot expect your staff to wear half sleeve shirts in this weather in Delhi. It is ill-advised and lacks common sense to expect your staff to wear their uniform and come to work. On the contrary, the uniform should be sanitised and carried securely, only to be worn at the premises and stored at the place of service to minimise chances of infection for patients who the attendants are in close proximity to for the day.

I am unaware of how your attendants are serving other customers, or your internal policy in this regard, but from what I have heard and experienced, Portea needs to genuinely introspect on its operations. There is tremendous room for improvement that will only improve your standing and reputation in the market.

Mr. Akash has so far been doing a very good job and rather than take punitive action against him, the matter should be first thoroughly investigated. If the concern of your attendant is genuine, it would do you good to address that first and maybe take action against those who perpetrated this development.

I sincerely request you to act fairly."

1]  Booking of Appointment
2]  Payment of the bill
3]  Visit for blood collection
4]  Reporting of the results

Booking of Appointment : Although I used the website to book appointment, there was no response - either by mail or in form of call. I had to call toll free number to know that my request has been accepted and it has been assigned to a resource. That is not a pleasant experience


Payment of the bill : It was smooth and the most pleasing experience

Visit for blood collection : The resource called up in morning and came before breakfast, as requested, and after breakfast. The visits were on schedule and it was a pleasant experience 

 
Reporting of the results : The sample was collected on 30th December and the results were expected next day. When i checked on 1st January, the report was availalbe online with date of 31st December, but I was not able to access it. When I called customer service on 1st January and I was told that reports are not uploaded and it seems that there is a technical problem and they would send me report in mail.
I waited till 2:30PM on 2nd January and again when i checked online, it still same status. When I called customer service, they stated that reports are not yet available from labs. It took them another 30 minutes to call me back to inform that they have mailed me the reports. 
Reports, which were expected by evening 31st were delivered on afternoon 2nd January. For such important and critical service, such a delay can become a matter of life and death. 

I have decided not to use Portea any more for my requirements and would be sharing my experience on social media and blogs to let other users make informed decissions

       I contacted the Bangalore lab(+918042734900)4 times (last with Srinivas) and informed that they will get back to me. No concrete step was taken by the staff to contact me to arrange for a recollection of sample for testing. I was totally disappointed with the no-action team of persons responsible for taking the call. For sure, I will not recommend Portea for my friends or relatives. Rather, I am going to tell them not to think of getting the test done thru Portea.

I have asked for a back-up of good quality so that if and when the current one becomes a nurse (she has given her exams) the new person can give the same care to the patient. But the lack of staff is the problem. The nurse attendants come from so far that it affects punctuality as well as the energy to do a good job. The hierarchy at Bangalore should review this situation in Pune and provide solutions. You continuously ask for feedback but are slow in acting on the feedback. The supervisor hardly reviews the performance. I was told that the supervisor will visit once a week to review the performance.

This time I persisted and the plan went through. However, the attendants are worse than house servants, not trained with even basics, completely dumb and my attendant would keep going multiple times a day down the building sometimes for 50 minutes without informing. I am just pulling along because I have no choice but the service and staff are nothing like promised and advertised. To top it all, I had clearly mentioned that the weekly off was to NEVER be on the week end since I am out, but last week at 10pm, I got a message saying that the replacement was for Sunday 22 Jan. I had to make calls, make a scene and it was then shifted to Monday 23rd. No prior visit to understand medicines or routine was planned till I had to again insist on it. This week, I got a message last night at 7 pm saying the regular attendant would take an off on Sunday 29th!! I am too fed up to fight.

"3750",267000,"Bangalore","LTN",1,3,2,3,4,13,0,0,"We've had a mixed experience with your attendant Pramita and 'very poor experience' with your local customer care manager and attendant supervisors. (I have already shared details on the same with your call centre staff)

Pramita:
-She was good as far as 'having someone' around the patient was concerned. 
She needs to improve on the foll:
- Training on basic things like measuring bp, following up with patients exercise etc. Currently apart from bathing patient, Pramita had nil knowledge about patient care and had to be trained by us.
- Lack of punctuality, she would arrive late most days when she was travelling to and fro the hostel.
- Lack of phone etiquette ie always on the cell phone, talking for hours one end
- Poor personal hygiene, too many head lice regarding which we had to spend on shampoo treatment which also did not work and then we had to cut patients and relatives hair, and finally had to request her to have a haircut and also pay for it. This should be supervisors job who never answered the phone.
- Asking for personal things like phone charger and headphones of the patients relatives and not returning them
- Lack of initiative to fully take care of the patients needs such as putting out the used diapers garbage, or getting the patient dressed, or helping patient with simple household tasks. These are part of a fulltime attendants responsibility and she lacked the initiative to do them.
 
Local customer care manager and supervisors never answer the phone or any customer queries, would not give the attendant her travel allowance on time and we had to pay her the same. Customer care mgr always gave excuse that either he is out of town or in hospital. Very poor.

If Pramita has proper training and strict supervision, she may have some potential to be better.

Another very important feedback is that a fulltime attendant needs to be trained by Portea to attend 'fully' to the patient and not expect the patients relatives to attend to them. We have a cleaning lady and a cook at home to take care of basic cooking and cleaning. Apart from this, the few tasks related to patient care such as taking out diapers garbage, folding patients laundry, were requested of Pramita. She did them readily but later complained that they were 'extra' tasks. Kindly ensure that when we pay approx 36000 per month for an attendant, she is expected to take care of basic patients needs and not expect us to employ an additional army of staff to serve her instead.

Overall, we did not get the value for the amount we paid. In such a competitive market with new players coming in, we recommmend Portea looks into these things and improves, otherwise patients and their relatives will look for other better choices.

The other major issue is that Portea is exploiting its staff like Parveen and not paying their salaries on time. I have personally taken up the issue and have spoken to Bindu (sanjana's supervisor) as well as HR.

Also would like to give a suggestion that please do a thorough back ground check because the children are away from their parents and they depend on you to take care of them. 
though i am not really sure what prompted him to do such things but it is matter of people lives which is there in your hands.

I immediately called the customer to report the same, i was informed by customer care that they would get back to me in half hour with the update. i told them the next day we have fixed an appointment with the doctor at 6pm. My grievance started from my first call, get a call in response was out of question but nobody could help me get the complete report. I kept on calling till next day 5pm and i was still not getting any response, finally i had to raise my voice and push the executive, he kept me on hold for a good amount of time and then informed me that the reports have just come and he is mailing it to me. 5.30pm i received the reports and 6pm was our docs appointment. 
Is this the level of commitment and responsibility Portea undertakes. This is not Amazon or Flipkart, you guys a running a medical service and this has to be taken seriously as 1 extended day can delay treatment and can cause grievance to the patient. 
I never got a call since the time i first called informing you about the incomplete report till the time i received it next day evening that too after continuously making multiple calls and speaking to multiple people. I would not recomend Portea to anybody infact have updated my friends and relatives to never use your unreliable service.

We called Portea on the 1-800 number several times, but could not get anyone to come on the line. We received an sms to tell us that someone would call us back and no one called us back. We also tried to call the Field Officer who hung up the phone.
We somehow managed to convince Mr Wagh that his salary for 7 days of work would be paid by Portea in the next one or two days. 
However, we received a call today, 10th March, from Mr Wagh, to inform us that he STILL HAS NOT BEEN PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND THAT HE HAS BEEN DUPED BY THE FIELD OFFICER. 
Not only does Mr Wagh feel that he has been duped by Portea, but we also feel that we have been duped by your company, by sending us an attendant who is not at all on your registered rolls.
I WOULD LIKE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM YOU IN THIS REGARD AND WOULD INSIST THAT YOU PAY MR WAGH FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED BY HIM FOR 7 DAYS IMMEDIATELY.
For your records, our Receipt Voucher No. is 199130 dated 27/2/17, for the amount of Rs.5725/-, fpr services from 27/2/17 to 5/3/17.
PLEASE TREAT THIS MATTER AS URGENT AND RESOLVE THIS WITH MR WAGH IMMEDIATELY BY PAYING HIM HIS DUES AND REVERT BACK TO US TO INFORM US THAT THE PAYMENT HAS BEEN SETTLED.
We do not wish to receive any more calls from Mr Wagh to inform us that he has not yet been paid."

Sofar as medicine supply was concerned, it was woefully bad . On the basis of your own SMS messages to me, no supply was effected again inspite of repeated reminders. The crowning ineffectiveness of Portea was revealed when your Mr Naveen Singh himself firstly refused to take my calls and reached him through another phone, he lied that he would come back to me on delivery status. This happens when vital drug requirements were involved. Can anything be more unprofessional and irresponsible you are as a portal wanting to succeed ? At this rate, sooner than later your essay is fated to fail. I am sorry to say this but it is the harsh truth.

The nurse in question, K Punitha is meticulous and organized and takes pride in her job. Her only shortcoming is that she often takes any suggestions as a criticism of her actions."
"4409",314656,"Mumbai","P",1,1,1,1,1,5,0,-4,"Team, this is the worst kind of service that was provided. I had considered Portea thinking it is a large organization and will be able to provide uninterrupted services (as also confirmed by Mr Sanjiv Kumar who was the first person we connect with). Nursing care for elderly is a sensitive service where it is not just about sending a person but to be aware of the needs of the person and relations (care giver). The reason such a service is take as it takes of load of the care giver.

My experience ranged from people not turning up and every day change in persons, to the point I had to do a followup by calling to find who is coming the next day. Your customer relationtionship manager dosent pick up calls (and finds it convenient to sms only on critical service issues) and we had to micromanage the people. Information was not provided to the point that on 13th till we checked at 5.30-6pm (for services starting at 7pm) we didn't know who was coming, and nobody was also available on that day, which ment my mother was awake the whole night. The last day of 15days service the person (and not Mr Raj Kiran) left the house by 5.30am without informing).

There is a serious lack of coordination and it seems like Portea is just providing the aggregation platform and rest is left to very local service providers. It feels more like a manpower management company and not like a very serious service provider.

Very very dissatisfied and would definitely not recommend.
